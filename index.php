			Hi, I'm Brandon Steider. Just a little bit about me, I like a lot of things. I've been very active my whole
			LIfe.I dirtbike, I snowboard, I skate, I write, I play piano, trumpet, ukulele, and guitar. Music basicaly runs
			in the family. My dream in life is the be an astrophysicist or a famous writer. Coding is a good career for me
			considering I have always been around technology, and I really enjoy it. I secretly love comcast and hate when
			individuals talk badly about it. ALL HAIL COMCAST... I also hate Star Trek with a passion. So I don't know how I will be able to get
			through this class hearing about this Gene Roddenberry garbage.

			I enjoy a good snack of spam. Spam is the best when it's grilled and glazed with honey. I've always wanted to make
			a trip to St. Louis. Maybe Dylan will take me there and show me around such a great city.

			I dress up like one of Immortan Joe's minions and ride to Valhalla!
			ALL HAIL VALHALLA!
